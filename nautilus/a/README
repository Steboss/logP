Here I am recreating molecule A from molecule E 
In Maestro I have switch F atoms to H
Then I have extracted the original frcmod and off files of molecule A
Remapped all the atoms
By using tleap then I reacted SYSTEM.top and SYSTEM.crd

Folders:

1_input:  all the steps to create molecule A

test :   test folder ( we can remove it)

SYSTEM.top, SYSTEM.crd and SYSTEM.pdb : top crd and pdb of mol A
