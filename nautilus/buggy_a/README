Preparation for nautilus analysis

1_input:  inputfiles from molecule a vacuum simulations

2_tleap : creation of top and crd with tleap, starting with pdb created with maestro - symmetric molecule

3_sire : sire equilibration with frozen residue, here I extract rst7 from snapshot 541

4_final_structure: final structure SYSTEM.top SYSTEM.crd  to be used in Nautilus

SYSTEM.top SYSTEM.crd : top and crd to use in Nautilus
