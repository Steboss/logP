Calculation with ipynb of the most likely dihedral C1-C2-C10-C11 in a trajectory
To calculate C1-C2-C10-C11 dihedral I have took three different trajectories of 
molecule E in water:
1) From lambda-0.000 Run001 discharging step
2) from lambda-0.000 Run002 discharging step
3) from md_simulation in this folder

The value of C1-C2-C10-C11 dihedral is on aveage 300 degree
