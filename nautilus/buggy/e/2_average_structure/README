Here I am computing the  average structure by using cpptraj as:

cpptraj -p SYSTEM.top

loadcrd md.traj
#strip the water
strip :WAT
#now compute the rms to get rid of translation and rotation on molecule 1
crdaction md.traj  rms first :1
#extract the average 
crdaction md.traj average avg.dcd


At the end we will have the average structure of the molecule
