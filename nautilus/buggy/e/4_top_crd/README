antechamber  equilibration  nautilus_struct.mol2  nautilus_struct.pdb  SYSTEM.crd  SYSTEM.top  tleap.dat
I have re-created the "symmetric" structure of the molecule with maestro
Then I processed the molecule with antechamber in order to have the mol2 files
Charges and atom types were tested and resulted to be the same as before
Thus I proceeded with the paremetrization in tleap (tleap.dat) and then a little 
equilibration to equilibrate the density of the solvent
From the final trajectory I have obtianed I extract the frame 766, which was the best
in terms of equilibration and symmetry of the structure

Content:

antechamber:  antechamber folder where I created the mol2 file

equilibration: equilibration run with Sire

nautilus_struct.mol2: initial symmetric structure
nautilus_struct.pdb: corresponding pdb of the mol2

SYSTEM.top , SYSTEM.crd: top and crd created from mol2 file

tleap.dat : command file to be given to tleap  : tleap -f tleap.dat


Reproduce:

(Here the mol2 is already created)
Run tleap:
tleap -f tleap.dat

then 
cd equilibration/output
~/sire.app/bin/somd -C ../sim.cfg -t ../SYSTEM.top -c ../SYSTEM.crd -d 0 -p CUDA

then analyse the trajectory, to extract frame XXX do:
(in output folder)
cpptraj -p ../SYSTEM.top
trajin traj000000001.dcd  766 766
trajout solvated.rst7
go
quit
