Preparation for nautilus analysis

1_input:  inputfiles from molecule e fully interacting simulated at lambda=0.0 of the discharging step

2_average_structure:  computation of the average molecule e structure along the traj with cpptraj

3_nautilus_conf: lowest RMS structure w.r.t. average structure from the trajectory

4_top_crd : creation of top and crd 

5_final_structure: final CRD and TOP to use in Nautilus

SYSTEM.top SYSTEM.crd : top and crd to use in Nautilus
