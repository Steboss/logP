Here I am creating the molecule a starting from the backbone of molecule e


molecule e has been modified in order to have only hydrogen atoms  (rather than F)
then, I have extracted frcmod and off from the original molecule a
To reproduce:

cd off_frcmod
python off.py


the script will give as output a.frcmod and a.off


Unfortunately, here we have to remap all the atoms, since there is a mismatch - except from C1 to C6:

old(mol a map)   -->   new (mol a from mol e)

H1                             H5
H2			                       H6
H4                             H1
H3                             H7
H5                             H8
H6                             H2
H7                             H9
H8                             H10
H9                             H3
H10                            H11
H11                            H4
H16                            H15
H15                            H16
H14                            H12
H13                            H13
H12                            H14

C7                             C10
C8                             C9
C9                             C8
C10                            C7
C11                            C12
C12                            C11

then with the new a.frcmod and a.off ( in current folder) we can create molecule a with tleap as:

tleap -f tleap.dat


we will have molecule a, solvated in the same box as molecule e
N.B tleap will claim some warning about bond lengths, but they SHOULD be ok in the final topology
(to check you can go in comparison folder and run compare_mol.py :

python compare_mol.py

this will give as output: bond_compare.csv, with the list of all the bonds in the molecule and
their lenghts
and                       compare.csv  to compare the atoms of original molecule a and
the new molecule in terms of charge: BE AWARE! Remember that atoms have been remapped)

In folder remapped_off I have copy a.off and a.frcmod with corrected maps, to have a backup
