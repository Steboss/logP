Here I want to analyse the distribution of dihedrals in my molecules
If they lie around -60 and + 60 it means we have a chair conformations

conformational_analysis.ipynb   needs to create the input dihedral_files (collection of dihedral values)
boat_histogram.ipynb            give as output the histogram plot
