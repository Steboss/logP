Analysis folder:

- boat: here you can find conformational analysis performed on boat conformation simulations
        Inside the folder you will have:
        a) boat_histogram.ipynb  :  ipython notebook with histogram of the conformation distribution during the simulations
        for molecules : a,c,d and e
        b) Boat_conf_distribution.png: final png of the histogram
        c) conformational_analysis.ipynb:  conformational  analysis script, this script reads the trajectories and create
        csv files to use for histogram creation (I used this script once  and then save all the files in dihedral_files/
        so there is no need to waste time loading trajectories)
        d) dihedral_files: files with dihedrals values for each snapshot of  the trajectories ( -60 deg 60 deg should be a 
        chair conformation)

- chair: here you can find conformational analysis performed on chair conformation simulations
         Inside the folder you will have:
         a) chair_histogram.ipynb  :  ipython notebook with histogram of the conformation distribution during the simulations
         for molecules : a,c,d and e
         b) Chair_conf_distribution.png: final png of the histogram
         c) conformational_analysis.ipynb:  conformational  analysis script, this script reads the trajectories and create
         csv files to use for histogram creation (I used this script once  and then save all the files in dihedral_files/
         so there is no need to waste time loading trajectories)
         d) dihedral_files: files with dihedrals values for each snapshot of  the trajectories ( -60 deg 60 deg should be a 
         chair conformation)

- boat_4ns: same as boat, but in this case the simulations were 4 ns long rather than 2 ns

- gradient_analysis:  a) gradient_comparison_boat4ns_chair.ipynb : ipython notebook to compare gradient profiles between boat (4ns) 
                         simulations and chair
                      b)  gradient_comparison_boat_chair.ipynb: ipython notebook to compare gradient profiles between boat (2ns) and 
                          chair simulations
