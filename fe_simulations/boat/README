Inputfiles for a,c,d,e molecules starting with boat conformations
Some molecule may present a chair conformation, which was immediately adopted after a tiny 
minimization/equilibration in sander
molecule a is present in a_axial: the substituent is in axial position 
                         a_eq:    the substituent is in equatorial position
